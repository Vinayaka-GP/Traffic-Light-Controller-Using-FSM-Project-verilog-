# Traffic-Light-Controller-Using-FSM-Project-verilog-
This project implements a Finite State Machine (FSM) based Traffic Light Controller using Verilog. The system cycles through Red → Green → Yellow states to control traffic flow at a junction.  Design: FSM written in Verilog.  Testbench: Provides clock and reset stimulus, simulating changes.  Simulation tools: EDA Playground and EPWave.
